# Optimization-Agricultural-Crop-Production.-
This Project is to achieve an optimum agricultural production plan.Because I know that our lifestyle is based on Agriculture. if we don't do agriculture, then our whole economic system is Down. but nowadays many problems have arisen in agricultural production. the nature of the soil and the climatic conditions and many times, we face unpredictable changes in climate like non-seasonal rainfall or heat waves or fluctuations in humidity levels, etc. and all events cause more loss to our farmers and farming, because of which they are not able to utilize their agricultural land to it's fullest. that's why we are saluting our farmers because even after having so many problems, agriculture is doing it. So to solve all such problems, I have built a Machine Learning Model by which we can help farmers, optimize agricultural production because this predictive model will help them understand that for a particular soil & given climatic condition, which crop will be best suitable for the harvest.
